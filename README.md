## Business Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze and visually present the performance of the Top 15 NSE-listed companies in 2023 based on market capitalization. The dashboard helps investors and analysts track price trends, percentage changes, and candlestick patterns over different time intervals (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and custom date ranges), enabling better-informed investment decisions.

## Methodology
### Data Collection:

Historical stock price data for each of the top 15 NSE companies was sourced from the official NSE (National Stock Exchange of India) website.

The data for all companies was consolidated into a single dataset for ease of analysis and comparison.

### Stock Selection:

The top 15 companies were selected based on market capitalization, ensuring relevance and significance within the Indian stock market.

### Data Preparation & Calculation:

Custom calculations were created using Level of Detail (LOD) expressions in Tableau to determine starting and ending prices for each selected period.

#### Key calculations included:

tableau

// Current Close Price
Cr_Close_Date = IF [Date1]= {FIXED [Nifty Index1]: MAX([Date1])} THEN [Close1] END

// Previous Close Price
Pr_Close_Date = IF [Date1]= {FIXED [Nifty Index1]: MIN([Date1])} THEN [Close1] END

// Trend Color
Change = IF {FIXED [Nifty Index1]:MAX([Cr_Date_Close]) > MAX([Pr_Date_Close])} 
         THEN "green" 
         ELSE "red" 
         END
Line charts were dynamically color-coded:

ðŸ”µ Blue for upward trends

ðŸ”´ Red for downward trends
